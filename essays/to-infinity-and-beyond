The summer before college, I did an internship at the Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health at a research lab involving health analytics. It was my first time programming in R and I learned tons about research study design, R programming, and careers in data science. It was really fun being able to work with real-world data and examine patterns in the data to uncover new insights. 

Now the most recent summer, I was accepted into the University of Hawaii Cancer Center Summer Internship. It was another internship involving statistics and data analytics. It was awesome being exposed to the different types of wide-ranging research that the faculty members were conducting. I must admit that I was one of the few computer science students in the program while others were mainly biology majors. However, being exposed to people from diverse backgrounds and different disciplines made me more appreciative of everybodyâ€™s differences and elevated my communication skills. 

Definitely, data science and statistics has been very eye-opening. But, how is this related to humans and the world? This leads me to my developing interest in human computer interaction. How are users able to interact with the output of the analysis? Having done many internships in research, I am looking to expand my experience in the industry. I know that, for sure, there is always something to learn from an internship and my future classes. I am excited to see what awaits me in Summer 2023 and beyond!
