Having done programming using both object oriented programming languages like Java and statistical programming languages like SAS and R, functional programming is a beast of its own. It was quite confusing how you could use the keyword function or the keyword const to declare a function and the arrow operator was also puzzling. Well, so is Javascript good or bad? Like everything around us, it has its merits and its drawbacks. It is nice that you donâ€™t have to waste time typing extra syntax in Javascript like there is no data type that you declare when you make variables. Functions are first-class, meaning that functions can be passed as arguments, functions can be returned, and functions can be assigned to variables. How powerful is this! Everything is simple and to the point. However, this simplicity is just too simple for me since I am used to everything having a type ranging from functions to variables. I am sure that I will quickly get used to the simple syntax that can save me much time.

## More Gym Time? 

As a regular visitor of the Warrior Recreation Center at University of Hawaii at Manoa, doing WODs should mean more fun and increases in levels of dopamine. But, these WODs are a part of athletic software engineering, meaning no sweat is involved, only brain power. So this type of WOD exercises my brain muscle instead of typical cardio that exercises my heart and lungs. Well, maybe it exercises my heart as well since the timer is going off and I am panicking! Knowing that many companies conduct technical interviews that are timed, getting some exercise with the mentality and concept of knowing my Javascript syntax very well during class definitely helps. This style of learning is stressful, for sure, but I am sure that I will greatly benefit from this in-class gym in the future.
