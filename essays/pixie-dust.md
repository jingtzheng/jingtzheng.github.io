When I first began using HTML and CSS to create a website, it was quite frustrating. Since I was a newbie to all of this, sometimes I wanted some text in the middle of the photo but the text just wouldn’t go right in the center. I tried a lot of different methods until I finally got it. I know that knowing basic CSS is actually really important because you can use it to manipulate and tailor the webpage to what you want instead of using the default ways but it just felt quite challenging. 

## Booting the website
Using UI Frameworks like Bootstrap 5 definitely makes everything just a tad bit easier. When I first started using Bootstrap 5, it was difficult to understand how it worked. But through multiple examples and practice, I finally understood that Bootstrap focused on containers and classes for the different elements. I could just center the text using “text-center” instead of the messy, complicated CSS. I don’t have to spend a lot of time focusing on the details of each style and writing up code from scratch but rather focus on the look and feel of the webpage in order to create the best user experience. 

I tried recreating a website using Bootstrap 5 (see below for picture) and overall it went well. The picture on the left is the original website and the one on the right is the one that I created. Although the website that I created does not look exactly like the original website, I am confident that as I build my web development skills, I will be able to create good-looking websites that are user-friendly.
