Before I began ICS 314: Software engineering, I thought that computer science meant the same thing as software engineering. However, as I progressed through the class, I like to say that I learned a different aspect of computer science where the focus was less on theory but more on the practical application of computer science. I am sure that the concepts that I learned in this class will be useful for internships and jobs. 

## Open Source Development

In the class, we used a lot of open source technologies like Bootstrap, MongoDB, React, Meteor. In the future, I hope to be able to contribute to open source projects starting from the very basics like improving documentation. Open source can lead to faster development and innovation to create systems that are more reliable and advanced since developers can find and fix bugs more rapidly. Moreover, open source can lead to new technologies and applications. 

## Ethics in Software Engineering

Ethics in software engineering is also another important topic. This topic often refers to ethical issues in the use and design of technology especially as software engineers, our actions can change the world. I think this aspect of ethics also influences the industry that I would want to work in because how the product that I am working on can influence people is also an important factor. As a computing professional, it is of essence to respect privacy, confidentiality and contribute to the society and human-well being.
