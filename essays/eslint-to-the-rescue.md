## Linting the program
ESLint. What an interesting name! After doing a little bit more research about ESLint and its friends, I realized that all coding tools to check programming and stylistic errors are called something-lint. It is definitely fascinating how the name draws itself from clothes that have lint and we would use a lint roller to remove lint. In terms of computer science, it takes a program that might have errors and uses a linter to check. 

## Best practices
Coding standards are a great way to ensure that the code adheres to the coding standards. Even beyond that, it is a great way to ensure that the code can be read by other engineers, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. This is even more important as everything in computer science requires some form of collaboration and writing code that is of good quality will ensure effective communication. Coding standards can definitely improve my understanding of the Javascript programming language like when to use const or let to declare a variable. ESLint checks the entire document to see if I have changed the variable and if I did not, then it tells me to use const instead of let, which is super helpful.

Now going back to ESLint. The majestic green checkmark at the upper right hand corner is definitely comforting. However, when I am programming, red squiggly lines begin to appear under the lines that I write which becomes a little bit bothersome. I know I have errors because I am not done coding yet! The red color yells to me, telling me to fix it, while I am also trying to finish programming that part. I am sure I will get used to the red squiggly lines and the green check mark that follows soon to ensure exceptional code quality and all the better software engineering practices.
