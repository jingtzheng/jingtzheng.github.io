## My curiosity

As a curious child, I have always asked questions. I would always ask 'why' and 'how' and often jump ahead of the lectures. Teachers would always say "Wait, it is on the next slide. We are getting there!" Sometimes, the teachers tell me that they don't know the answer either or you don't need to learn that in-depth. But, the curious me just had to learn about the topic to the very nitty-gritty bits. Teachers would always mention to me that there are no dumb questions so just ask away! But is this applicable to the real-life beyond the walls of the classroom?

## A question considered as not as SMART

Over the recent years, Stack Overflow has emerged as the top platform to ask for help on technical questions that programmers are encountering. As programmers range from various skill levels, the quality of questions can also range from bad to good questions. 

The following example demonstrates a question that is not as smart. The author of the question seeks to write python code for certain conditions. Here is a link to the [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75187919/i-need-help-coding-this-scenario).

```
Q: I need help coding this scenario

I can watch another episode before bed:

If it it is before 1 AM and I don't have work or class in the morning

or it is the weekend.

Using python code this scenrio

```

Firstly, this person’s title is rather abstract. The person does not specify the particular issue that she/he is running into but rather just mentions that “they need help”. Moreover, the person has typos in his/her problem description, further delaying the much-needed help that is desired. The person does not mention what he/she has tried to do to solve the problem. This type of question could be easily solved by doing a simple google search but it seems like the person wants someone else to do the homework for them. 

```
Q: How do I compare strings in Java?

I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.

Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?

Here is a link to the [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java).

Firstly, this person’s title is to the point and descriptive. He/she explains the issue that they are running into in a simple way. In the description, they mention that they usually use the == operator to compare strings. Unfortunately, they ran into a bug and used .equals() instead and it fixed the bug. This question can definitely be done with a simple google search but at the date of the post, I believe the resources on google were not sufficient to answer the question the person asked. Moreover, it seemed like the person did a google search to try to see what alternatives there are to the == operator and tried it in their code. They asked the question on stack overflow for a deeper understanding of the overall concepts of comparison in java. At the end, they also asked what the difference is between == and .equals(), showing their desire to learn more about it 

## The closing of non-smart questions

Definitely, Stack Overflow has been the number one platform where programmers seek answers to these pressing questions. Creating smart questions would only further benefit us and others that might have the same question and problem. Smart questions allow people around the world to understand what issue you are specifically having and do their best using their expertise to help you. Therefore, it is important that as a programmer, we communicate clearly on Stack Overflow and this extends beyond to our clients, managers, and colleagues.
