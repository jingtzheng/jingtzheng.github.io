Medical Innovation and Design Hawaii is a program where students and faculty from various fields ranging from business, medicine, engineering come together to solve challenging medical problems. 

For this project, we collaborated with the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children Concussion Clinic to design a mobile application that could allow patients and healthcare providers communicate outside of regular appointment times. The main goal is to create an engaging platform to improve collaboration in rehabilitative care. Self-reflection criterias were also incorporated to encourage patients to reflect on their progress in care. Exercises will be assigned based on the individual's condition and patients will be encouraged to do these activities and self-reflection between their visits. Appointments will also continue to take place at the hospital clinic as this mobile application is meant to be a supplemental solution.
