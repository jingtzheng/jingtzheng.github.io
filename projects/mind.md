Medical Innovation and Design Hawaii is a program where students and faculty from various fields come together to solve challenging medical problems. 

For this project, we collaborated with the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children Concussion Clinic to develop a mobile application that could allow patients and healthcare providers communicate outside of regular appointment times.
