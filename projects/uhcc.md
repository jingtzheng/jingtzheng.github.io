summary: "I presented my findings on the topic of comparing dietary indicies among adults and children in the Pacific"

During my research internship at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, I stumbled upon a journal article regarding how radiologists in the United States were training healthcare workers in Africa to conduct breast cancer screenings as part of a two year program. I was thinking about how expensive this process was and the possibility of using machine learning instead as a supplemental form to breast cancer detection in screenings. I also attended a seminar talk by Dr. Carol Boushey where she explained how there has been increasing research on the use of image-based dietary assessment in nutrition involving both passive approaches like wearable devices and active approaches like mobile apps, piquing my interest in ubiquitous computing. These research ideas sparked my interest in the intersection of software, systems, and society and the overall implications of these revolutionary software advances in the world.

I conducted research at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center under Dr. Lynne Wilkens. I worked independently on a research project where I compared the dietary indices between adults and children living in the Pacific. I performed statistical analysis, data wrangling, and data visualization using SAS and communicated my findings through a poster presentation to faculty researchers and the community.
