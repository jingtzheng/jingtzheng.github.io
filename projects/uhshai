At the Pacific Health Analytics Collaborative, as a research assistant, I analyzed national Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data from the Centers for Disease and Control using the programming language R. Using the data, I conducted a study regarding the association between substance use and bullying among youth in Hawaii. I collaborated with epidemiologists, data scientists, and public health researchers on this study. The data was further analyzed using statistical computing like chi-square test, multiple logistic regression, and odds ratio. My insights were communicated using data visualization packages like ggplot2 in R. I also conducted a thorough scientific literature review and learned how to conduct reproducible, replicable, and ethical research. I also attended seminars and professional development workshops with speakers from HMSA, Hawaii Department of Health, the Queenâ€™s Medical Center, and the University of Hawaii.
