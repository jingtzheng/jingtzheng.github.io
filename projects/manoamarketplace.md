Manoa Marketplace is a team project for ICS 314 where we created a web application that provides a safe and simple method for students and faculty to buy and sell items on campus. Main technologies that were used include React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, Meteor.js. This project used a issue driven development system. I learned a lot about working in a team because My contributions include creating the MongoDB collection, overall user interface design, creating the add listings page, admin all listings page, and admin reported users/listings page, created listing component, added a delete functionality to all listings, and wrote testing for all the pages.
