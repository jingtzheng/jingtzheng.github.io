---

I am currently conducting research under Dr. Peter Washington where I develop web applications for affective computing. In this project, users are able to record a video of themselves acting out an emoji and will assign a caption to the video in a fun and engaging way. The data will then be used to curate a diverse emotion expression dataset that will be used in machine learning to create models that can recognize emotion. User studies will conducted based on human-computer interaction design methods. Research has been approved by the University of Hawaii Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

The main tools used are Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL database, and Amazon Web Services S3 & EC2. Visit the [website](https://emojigif.hawaiidigitalhealthlab.com/) to participate in the research study!
