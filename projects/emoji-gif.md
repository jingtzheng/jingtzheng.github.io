I am currently conducting research under Dr. Peter Washington where I develop web applications for affective computing. Users are able to record a video of themselves acting out an emoji and will assign a caption to the video. The data will then be used to curate a emotion expression dataset. Research has been IRB Approved by the University of Hawaii Institutional Review Board. 
You can find my final poster below.
