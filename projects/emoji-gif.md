---

I am currently conducting research under Dr. Peter Washington where I develop web applications for affective computing. In this project, users are able to record a video of themselves acting out an emoji and will assign a caption to the video in a fun and engaging way. The data will then be used to curate a emotion expression dataset that will be used in machine learning to create models that can recognize emotion. User studies will run using human computer interaction design and methods. Research has been IRB Approved by the University of Hawaii Institutional Review Board. 

The main tools that are being used are Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Amazon Web Services.
